# Executive Summary

BOSCore is pleased to announce a BOS development incentive program with the goal of releasing 100 million BOS into the EOSIO ecosystem. The program involves a process of checks and balances that begins with a community referendum, by which the community chooses suitable proposals for funding support. If approved proposals can proceed to development and subsequent BOS Core Executive team review, auditing and funding. Other EOSIO ecosystem contributors can also apply for fund support, so that multi-chain, interoperability can realise aligned ecosystem incentives, enabling communities to prosper together.

# 1. Background

This proposal is a BOS development incentive program proposed by the founding core teams of BOS. The goal is to continue to support the development of core protocol and the expansion of the entire EOSIO ecosystem.

BOSCore will set up an environmental fund of 100 million BOS for infrastructure construction, protocol standard setting, code optimization, and ecological partner incentives, etc. Other EOSIO eco-contributors can also apply for fund support, and multi-chain can achieve greater prosperity together.

After this proposal is approved, BOSCore will deposit 100 million BOS into a designated account, which will be managed by BPs and used according to community referendum.

# 2. BOS Executive Team

  Founded by several senior members of the EOSIO community, each member is veteran in the blockchain industry, involving wallets, mining pools, exchanges, and many other companies. The members have extensive experience in the field of Bitcoin, Ethereum and EOS. Each member is committed to blockchain technology, improving human productivity and freedom.

# 6. Fund payment process points:
1. The community chooses suitable proposals for fund support by referendum.
2. The amount of a single proposal incentives cannot exceed 1 Million BOS. Generally, after the deadline expires, the proposal incentives are automatically paid.
3. 10 days before the deadline, if the BOS Executive Team believes that the task has not been effectively executed, it has the right to temporarily freeze the payment of funds and submit the payment proposal to BP vote. BOSCore Executive Team checkpoints:
* estcase coverage, whether the test passed?
* Whether the coding quality is up to standard?
* Whether the specified functions in the proposal are fully implemented?
* Is there a security bug?
4. If the fund payment is frozen, the BOS independent auditor needs to publish the review within 7 days, make independent judgment in the contract, and issue a link to the relevant investigation report.
5. Within two weeks after the auditorâ€™s comments, BP needs to make a decision. If more than 2/3+1 active BPs agree to continue to pay the incentives, it will continue to pay 90% of the incentives; Otherwise the payment will be rejected.
6. The 10% of the incentives for the proposal are equally divided between the auditors who agree with the majority of the BPs and the BPs who voted.
